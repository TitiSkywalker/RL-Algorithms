# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This repository implements some basic deep RL algorithms in pyTorch. They are developed and tested in **OpenAI Gymnasium**. PPO is further improved and tested in **Arcade Learning Environment** and **Google Research Football**. 

## Acknowledgments
*OpenAI Spinning Up* provides various materials for deep RL: https://spinningup.openai.com. There is a list of key papers in deep RL.

*Hugging Face Deep RL Course* helped us implement PPO: https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course.

*Reinforcement Learning* by 斎藤 康毅 is a great textbook for RL. Our implementation of Q-learning, policy gradient and actor-critic is based on this book. We have changed the implementation from DeZero to PyTorch and made some improvements. The original repository is [here](https://github.com/oreilly-japan/deep-learning-from-scratch-4).

*OpenAI Gymnasium* provides basic environments ldeal for deep RL: https://gymnasium.farama.org/.

*Arcade Learning Environment* provides Atari 2600 environments: https://ale.farama.org/environments/.

*Google Research Football* is a very good football simulator. The repository is [here](https://github.com/google-research/football).
